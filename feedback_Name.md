Week 4:

Because there was no website <yang479>.github.io existing in my GitHub repository, I established one. 
I also add content that is different from the template file on the website and format it. It is a paragraph about my codes.

Since there is no file called Reflection.txt, I created it.
I also wrote some reflections in it:

"I think this Practical is quite difficult. 
First, I should remember the name of codes I learned in the lecture.
Second, I always ignored some small characters, such as ":" or ",".
Third, I always forgot the pseudocodes.
However, I think I will overcome them with my efforts."



Week 5:

In the variables.py file, I should have tested three combinations.
However, I made a mistake in the third combination: it is the same as the second one.
Therefore, I correct it by changing "X=False Y=True" to "X=True Y=False" in the third combination. 



In the fibonacci.py, I have no detailed pseudocodes. (only warning, not what is happening) 
I added these pseudocodes to make it up:
#input the default data
#print a,b(the first two number)
#start the loop of Morphebonacci
#count the loops
#the third number is the sum of the first and second number 
#the second number became the first number
#the third number became the third number
#print the Morphebonacci sequence

Week 6:

In the pie chart of the file for comparing coronavirus infection rates, I forgot a plot title.
Therefore, I added a plot tile by these codes:
"plt.title("The pie chart of the total cases in five countries") #add the plot title" 

In the file for list manipulation, I didn't sort the list of average exon length numerically.
Therefore I made it up by these codes:
"average_exon_length.sort()"
